squares = []
for values in range(1, 11):

    squares.append(square)
print(squares)
#  or we can write more concisely 
# squares.append(value ** 2) instead of making a new variable and appending that variable to squares
#  we can use min(), max(), sum() for finding minimum number in a list, for maximum we have max function
#  for sum of the list we have sum function
